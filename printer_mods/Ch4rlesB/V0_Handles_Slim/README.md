My V0 is in my garage and my shop in the other room. Moving it back and forth for repairs was a pain as the V0.1 has no real place to grab it.

And so I made handles that don't protrude much from the sides (16mm) of the tophat keeping the footprint as close to stock as possible.

To mount:
- 4x M3x12 (8 for both sides)
- 3x M3 Nut (6 for both sides)

Print the two of the file that fits with your side panel thickness
- 2.5mm
- 3mm

**You will have to add 3 nuts to the top extrusions as the handle replaces the top panel clip and requires 4 nuts (3 new + 1 old from panel clip)**
